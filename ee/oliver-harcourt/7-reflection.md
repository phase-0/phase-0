 What did I do well this sprint?
I'm happy with how I did on the eloquent JS exercises, I found that using pencil and paper to pseudocode worked really well for me to get my head around the challenge.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I didn't do so well on the freecodecamp challenges and I let that get to me a bit and started to doubt myself. I also attended a check in, wooooo! (have to get excited by the little things)

 What can I improve on next sprint?
next sprint I wan to challenge myslef a bit more on some exercises and try to work through more of the freecodecamp ones to start getting more comfortable with them.
