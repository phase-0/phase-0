What did I do well this sprint?
I think what I did well was take the time to try and play around with the different things we were doing in Udacity. I am the type of person who learns by doing and trying things out and this really helped me to understand what they meant. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I felt really preoccupied with work this week and I think that I found it hard to put that aside and focus on the study. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
Take a few more breaks. I also want to give myself the time to unwind from work and put that aside before trying to do study.
