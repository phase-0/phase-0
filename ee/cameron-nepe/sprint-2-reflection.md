What did I do well this sprint?
Using gitbash to stage, commit and push. I am still not sure how the pull thing works, but I am sure I will get plenty of exercise in the coming sprints

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't like the part about having to make a comment on my classmates work. I feel inadequate or incompetent about coding myself. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
I can give more time on tutorials, e.g. Udacity, instead of just going through them to get through the sprint faster.
