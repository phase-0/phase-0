<h2>What did I do well this sprint?</h2>

I feel like I didn't really tackled this sprint as I would have wished. In what I did well, I would say I really gave myself time to do it, but then I did forgot about it and pushed it away a lot. I am still happy with the fact that I am taking myself in charge back to finish it (as of right now) and push further to keep getting entertained by code and learning and not get overwhelmed by fear of doing it.

<h2>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h2>

This sprint felt like forever. I had issues maintaining my schedule to code, which definitively came from a lack of motivation. 
I need to redefine my goals and set my path straight to really benefit from the education I am getting. 

<h2>What can I improve on next sprint?</h2>

I need to make the difference on when I need to bring kindness to myself and take some quality time off, and when I am actually being lazy or unmotivated and the time I am taking off is to run away from issues I don't feel like tackling.
I need to give more reflection on why I push certain things away and why I am getting scared to fail - but not to let this reflection overtake my time and get my sunked in a negative loop.
