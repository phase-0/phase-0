 What did I do well this sprint?

This Sprint I got to get to the EDA location. I did reach for help quite a lot as well. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

This sprint was very hard on me as for my moral. I started pretty up, I end this quite on the down, I have been exponentially stressing to get time to work on it and merging it with my work days as well (where I work from 12 to 3pm then 5 to 11)starting the learning with 8am-3pm as the daily basis I defined last Sprint is very hard. 
I changed my OS from MAC to Windows and had to revisit the whole Command Line walk through which got me quite unerved - I still struggle to understand the filing in Babun as is I type something like find ~/ mydirectory I get nothing but looking for it via the Search file I get a path that makes me find it on Babun too...

 What can I improve on next sprint?

I can try to chill out - I have been very stressed for those last two days and I can definitively say that it brought nothing good to my life. So giving it a rest and taking it easy will at least be good. 
I can try not to take things personnaly as well when I reach out for answers and don't get any...
And definitively go hard on the kindness to myself and other - my husband and probably all the customers I serve have been getting much less smile and way more worry wrinkles. So next Sprint, better Sprint.
