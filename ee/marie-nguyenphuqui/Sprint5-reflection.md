<h2>What did I do well this sprint?</h2>

This sprint I got back on the enjoyment of experimenting with code. Like I planned to work on last sprint, when I found free time I got back into my website to rework on the reponsiveness of the CSS.
This sprint also I was proud of taking good notes which I do really use as reference when I get stuck on some problems.
Also I got quite happy resolving some untackled issues with the CSS of the blog pages. Seeing solutions to the problems when I was a little bit on a down on motivation last sprint and making things happen aside from the sprint content made me feel more independant and able to code on my own.

<h2>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h2>

I have been using less meditation as a tool this sprint - I find my focus less sharp and have been prone to distraction. 
I am found myself giving reason about not 'starting to work' more often than usual. I did find a good motivation back on track with this video, which I find very enticing : <a href='https://youtu.be/lB6K60mkmho'>Accelerated Learning: How To Get Good at Anything in 20 Hours</a>

<h2>What can I improve on next sprint?</h2>

I feel like I need not to get frustrated, or understand that if I get frustrated on something, I can either reach out, or if I feel like it is not the moment (like if I feel like I haven't tackled the problem enough to formulate even what I struggle with on it) find some exciting things to add on my website - or a side project I want to start building. I have been pseudocoding a lot of games or applications and I feel like now as anytime could be a good time to get started on actually getting at practicing what I know on them.
