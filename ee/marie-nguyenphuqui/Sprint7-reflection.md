<h2>What did I do well this sprint?</h2>

I really took the time to understand the aspects and use of functions in this sprint. I know that I am not in a rush to complete the sprint and I used some of the spare time to broaden my "programming thinking" more than getting stressed on completing the exercise in a timeframe. It improved my understanding upon reading the exercises and finding keys to the logic.

<h2>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h2>

Again I did take a lot of time to complete this sprint. Because I still struggle on finding correct time to schedule my learning sessions I sometime can take 5 whole days off without facing code at all. I had to read some of the concept twice to remember them. If I think about it, it has also the positive aspect of reinforcing my understanding of it - but maybe it also means that the first time I didn't really read it well enougth.

<h2>What can I improve on next sprint?</h2>

I will try to stick to a more regulated schedule on coding. I am starting a programming project with a friend back in France. This project has for me a lot of beneficial aspects because it helps me connect with a friend that I value and exercice some coding in the same time. I am excited about next sprint. I will try to come to EDA campus also more, I find that when I have little time to code, I focus better there.
