What did I do well this sprint?


Persistance in getting through tasks, when it seemed like it was hard to move on.
I felt I did well with the responsive design, with a lot persistance in getting through it.
I also felt that I answered the questions well, making it easy to understand and not too waffled. 




What didn't I do well this sprint?



Maybe I focused a bit too much on the responsiveness of the site between mobile and desktop views. Responsive design is a new leaning curve for me, but maybe you just have to focus on what it looks like on mobile and desktop view and then look at improving the sizes in between later on. It's just a matter of what the most important tasks are to get working correctly before moving on.



What can I improve on next sprint?


The big old enemy time. Making notes on key points in any videos, so that it cuts down on time later on would help with time. Looking for the easiest way to update my links with javascript would also help.
