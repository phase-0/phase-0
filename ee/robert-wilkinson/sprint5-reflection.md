What did I do well this sprint?


Through my reflection skills, I was able to put down the answers that quickly came to me. This meant that I was able to get through the technical blog quickly and I was happy about this. I also felt that I ended the sprint well by creating code that worked well for the coding assigments.  
 




What didn't I do well this sprint?

When I originally cloned my repository for DOM events and classes, I cloned it from dev academy challenges instead of my own username. This cost me a little bit of time to fix the problem, but it didn't take too long. Maybe I could of gone quicker on some parts of the sprint like the coding, but I think this was just due to nervs in terms of tackling the challenges. Fortunately I managed to get it all correct in the end and I was also happy about this. 





What can I improve on next sprint?

My time in getting through the sprint when I get a bit stumped or nervous on a challenge. I think I might need a bit more mindfulness practice when faced with challenges that make me nervous in the upcoming sprint. Hopefully this would put my mind at ease, in order to get through it all.
