What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I was able to learn HTML, CSS, get an introduction and very basic understanding of JavaScript and complete all the sprints in time for bootcamp.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Time management was my only concern looking back at the sprints, although I did improve as I went through the final 3 sprints.

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
I have had a recap on the listening skills and I believe these will be what benefits me most when it comes to working in pairs at bootcamp.
