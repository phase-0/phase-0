What did I do well this sprint?
I was able to work through the calculator challenge and get help when I needed it to end up with a working calculator

What didn't I do well this sprint?
There were a few times at the start where I felt overwhelmed by the challenge and kept putting it off.

What can I improve on next sprint?
If I face a challenge to stick with it and not put things off till later.
