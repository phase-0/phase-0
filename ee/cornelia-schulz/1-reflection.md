What did I do well this sprint?

I took my time and read through all the course material and had real fun going through the command line and especially Github tutorials.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I fumbled around with Toggl quite a bit because I didn't see the little toggle button on each card which makes things super easy.

What can I improve on next sprint?

My seating habits during study sessions needs to improve. I also need to make sure I take enough time to read through material, sometimes more than once just to ensure things stick.
