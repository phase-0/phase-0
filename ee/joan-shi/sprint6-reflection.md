What did I do well this sprint?
I was stucked in this sprint and I moved on to next sprint and came back to it this week.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I should have realized earlier that actually I don't have to use my very limited JavaScript knowledge to finish this sprint.Can google the proper code online or other cohorts' code for reference and absorb them(have to understand the code, that's the key).
What can I improve on next sprint?
Don't set myself limit. Google will be my loyal "hubby" to sit with.
