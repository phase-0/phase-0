What did I do well this sprint?
I haven't used any of the programs before (terminal, waffle, github, vs code) so I thought I did well in reading and understanding how to use these then implementing my understanding in building the website.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Tracking my time, I need to remember to switch Toggle on!

What can I improve on next sprint?
Being more aware of how long it takes me to complete a task, and taking more planned breaks.
