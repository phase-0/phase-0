What did I do well this sprint?
Writing notes for the Basic JavaScript course. This made it way easier to get my head
around the different concepts and rules when it came to the challenges.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I had to do the JavaScript course twice because the first time I did it I didn't write any notes and found it really difficult to remember what I had learnt and 
implement the rules when working on the challenges. Really glad I went back and took
the time to write notes and properly understand the basics, I know it will save me 
lots of time in in the long run. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
Attend a phase-0 group discussion.
