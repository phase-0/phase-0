What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint I felt like I did a much better job of timeboxing my tasks and being sure to focus on learning what was necessary to move on
without spending too much time researching each topic. This helped me get a real feeling of momentum and productivity. I also think I did
a good job of troubleshooting the problems with my mobile site while testing it during my redesign. I learned a lot about inspecting styling
using the developer tools to track down where problems may be occuring and also learned the importance of the viewport meta tag!

I also did a much better job of continuously working on the sprint each day so I didn't have to get through too much material on the weekends.

What didn't I do well during this sprint?

One thing I think I could have improved on in this sprint was being quicker to ask for help. I did get blocked for a while and though I was
able to solve the problem on my own I think it could have been much quicker if I had reached out for help. When I eventually did discuss the
problem with someone else I also found that their site had the same error mine had so I can see it was a good learning opportunity for others
also.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Next sprint I really want to focus on building on my habits. I hope to be even more controlled in my timeboxing but also to get into a good
schedule of meditation and exercise. At the moment I have been doing these without any real pattern and I think getting more regular with these
will help strengthen me mentally and physically to put even more energy into learning.
