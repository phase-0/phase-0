What did I do well this sprint?

I learnt the command line and github very quickly by setting time aside to memorise the commands thoroughly.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I need to start managing my time better, get into a routine of sorts. I tried to do this, this week but I was managing multiple things outside of study - now with that gone I will start managing my time strictly to finish before August.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Of course time management is the biggest thing I can improve on. I can also improve on using the techniques and habits that I have learn't this week to help me study and push me to finish my assignments quicker and to a higher standard.
