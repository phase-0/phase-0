What did I do well?

To be fair this week has been really hard, have been battling both some big health problems and dealing with some cheeky 
JavaScript. I think I did okay in making sure I didn't stress out over my work and despite the circumstances I think in the 
end I managed to timebox well to finish this sprint.

What didn't I do well?

I overthought a lot of the JavaScript questions... which led to me then not understanding the question. Need to work on this.

What can I improve on?

I think that I need to stop being so anxious about asking for help. Will try a lot harder to ask if needed be.
