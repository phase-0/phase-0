 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 - I did well when learning JS. It was fun learning new things, and making functions work. 
 I also made  notes during the phase0 when I learn something new in order to remember it longer.


 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 - I should have started earlier, and worked harder. I thought I could do it while working, but 
 work made me tired mentally and physically. I think it could be better if I more focused on 
 studying. 

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
 - Other than technical skills, I have learned how to study by myself using online courses and 
 resources and time management. And also for inner side, the mindfulness meditation helped me 
 a lot to control emotions. 
 The habits I have developed throughout the phase0 are : reflect, tidy, play, 
 perservere, explore, communicate, equinimity, hone and share.
