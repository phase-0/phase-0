 Sprint-2 Reflection

 What did I do well this sprint?

 I enjoyed what I had done so far. Sprint-1 was cruisy but I do feel my previous abilities peaked once I had to learn HTML properly and CSS for the first time, which I found was a good experience. The making of grids and boxes gave me some insight, so I enjoyed the process.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

 Folders. I need a practical way to start an application (any app would be nice) with my terminal, that way I wouldn't have to dig through Windows Explorer searching for the file I want to edit. 

 I use gitbash often and I've been experimenting with other terminal software.

 What can I improve on next sprint? 

 Indentation could've been improved in the code. I experimented with other formats before it came to the final code.
