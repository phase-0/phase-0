What did I do well this sprint?

I was able to use the skeleton framework as well as bootstrap to create a responsive website. I love the hamburger navbar for mobile. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I failed to focus solely on skeleton css. I think the reason for this, is after reading through the documentation I felt like it's helpful, but not suitable for my wireframes as it doesn't offer lots of options. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

Dedicate my time and remain focused. I had a few days off this week to refresh as I'm supposed to be on two week sprints. I will focus more on work life balance next sprint.
