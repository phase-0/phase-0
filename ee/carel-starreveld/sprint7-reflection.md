  What did I do well this sprint?
I think I was able to pick up the concepts better than with previous sprints, eloquentjavascript.net is a good resource with good explanations. Also the FreecodeCamp excersizes are better explained than as in previous ones

  What didn't I do well this sprint?
It still took quite a bit of time to go through the excersizes and I was not able to finish all the FCC excersizes within the time frame.

  What can I improve on next sprint?
Try and put more time into the self assesment excersizes for the cultural blog and perform meditation for longer periods of time.
