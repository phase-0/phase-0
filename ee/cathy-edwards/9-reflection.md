# What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0

In Phase 0, I juggled having a full-time job, household duties, social life, volunteering commitments, and managing my health to gain the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Given that I am just about wrapping up Sprint 9 today, I have achieved all of this before starting the bootcamp, so I am very proud of myself for having the self-discipline and rigor to be true to myself with what I want and put myself in the best position possible!

# What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I could have made more time to connect with my fellow cohort attendees. I could have gone through more extra cirricular materials such as books and YouTube videos. I could have had healthier sleeping patterns, too!

# What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

I have picked up the following lessons and habits:
* Self-reliance and reflection with my learning.
* Ability to use Git, VS Code, HTML, CSS and Javascript in ways I never had before.
* Meditation and relaxing techniques.
* Confidence, optimism and excitement for my learning journey during bootcamp!
