I have learnt alot through phase-0, as I only knew basic html and CSS when I started. I also have learnt alot through the emotional intelligence sections to help with feeling anxious. 
I felt fairly confident with my progress until I got to sprint 6/7, where I had to take some time away due to illness. It has been a bit of rush since then, but I have used the time boxing method well to get up to the point I am now. I am worried that my understanding is not thorough enough for bootcamp, as I really struggled with the calculator exercise. 
I plan to go into bootcamp with an open mind, not comparing myself to others. I plan to use my time wisely with time boxing.
