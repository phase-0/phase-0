I found myself blocked on this sprint. I dont whether it my anxitey, but I couldnt get my head around it at first and felt like I had forgotten everything I learnt the last few weeks. I spent alot of time revising, researching and watching tutorials. I eventually built the calculater with the help of a tutorial, and I can understand how it works. I'm not sure if how I've done it is the correct way however, as it is very different to how I have seen others complete this sprint. My code was also very short, so refactoring it was difficult as there wasnt much I could see that could make it shorter. I need to keep pushing forward and going over notes and practising and hopefully my confidence will grow.
