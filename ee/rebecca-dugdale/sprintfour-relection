What did I do well this sprint?<br><br>
This sprint went really fast for me because I had been doing little
pieces of the codecamp javascript course throughout my other sprints.
So I only had a few tasks to finish off.  In addition to that, I had
accidently read the first half of 'Search Inside Yourself' earlier
instead of just the first chapter so all in all I was a bit ahead of
myself for this one. <br><br>
 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br><br>
 That being said.... I still have to do a lot of work to <em>understand</em>
 Javascript.  I am glad that I will have the extra time before my
 cohort starts bootcamp in May to really go over and over the
 Java material until I feel like I have a really good handle on it,
 because at the moment I don't.<br><br>
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br><br>
 Considering I read ahead without intending to, I guess I should take more care to
 read instructions more carefully!
