 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 - I think I did well in looking into other sources that I'm not currently familiar with, like... I wanted my audio to loop flawlessly in my JS-art project, and I found HowlJS. I still need to do some learning within in, but I liked how there seems to be great support and documentation for ideas already out there. It felt really good.

 I found that looking into others code, searching for help on google and stack overflow helped me get a better unnderstanding on things.

 YouTube was also another great source that I ended up finding a tonne of channels that I'm now subscribed to.

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 - I think possibly sinking more hours into them? - I felt like at times I spent too much or too little time on things, which makes me feel like a master in some things, and then constantly seeking help in others (especially JS!) Overall I think I spent on average about 7-9 hours on each sprint, which I feel like I possibly could've slowed it down a little and spent a little more time in the JS area.

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
 - I have learn't A LOT in Phase-0 which I know I will carry over into Bootcamp. Probably one of the biggest things for me is that I need to stop stressing/panicking that I can't hold information, especially when I've just learnt it...

 Througout Phase-0 I would go through an exercise, understand the concept, work on the concept exercises, and then the next day... I couldn't write the code for that same concept off by heart... and I panic thinking "I SHOULD KNOW THIS OFF BY HEART!" but in reality, it will take a lot of practice to have it come naturally to me. 

 I also think that I've learnt a lot about how I like to learn! I certainly find videos PLUS documentation to be the best thing for me. So at times, there's certain things that are taught, and I don't quite get it, so I then go onto YouTube and watch practically the whole concept from scratch again to get a better understanding.

 I also think I've learnt alot about myself too, how I work, how I learn, how I feel and how I understand people, myself alot more too.
