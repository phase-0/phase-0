What did I do well this sprint?
- I think the best thing I did this sprint was to seek help in gaining a better understanding of how to put the calculator together.

Finding a new framework (jQuery) showed me how much time I can save writing code.

I also felt proud that throughout the calculator process I naturally thought of DRY. 

So once I came up to 8.2 I was pretty stoked I had already done this.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I was sick during this sprint so it certainly made things more difficult.

I think the main thing I didn't do too well with is the fact that I learnt jQuery (which took up a lot of time) but didn't actually put forgot to set my toggle timer, I spent atleast about 4 hours understanding jQuery.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 - Remember to set your timer!!!!
