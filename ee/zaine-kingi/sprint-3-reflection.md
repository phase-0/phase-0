# What did I do well this sprint?
In this sprint, I think I managed to get through the technical and cultural blogs fairly quickly, and my wireframes provided a really good guide when creating the templates as the variations between the wireframes and final templates were little if not none.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
I struggled abit understanding the instructions of the first sprint task, and I found it hard to follow the instructions when implementing the skeleton framework as the instructions didn't explicitly state I had to use it?

# What can I improve on next sprint?
Improvements for the next sprint, I will timebox my activities and try not to dwell on a task that I don't understand and instead use the Slack channel to get advice.
