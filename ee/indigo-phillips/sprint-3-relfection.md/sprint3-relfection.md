What did I do well this sprint?

This week I spent more time going over everything we have already learned these past few weeks working towards making sure I did not miss anything. Working through the process one step at a time, I slowed down and reflected on what I had produced and how I could improve. I found myself reworking 
with the rebuild of my head meaning I could utilize the box method and understand.


What I didn't do well this sprint?

With me being under pressure in other areas of my life this week I felt I could have completed the sprint in a quicker time frame. 


What can I improve on next sprint?

Focus on my mindfulness meditation and work towards adding a little more time. Spend more time on understanding process over product.
