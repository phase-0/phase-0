#Sprint tahi reflection
##What did I do well this sprint?
I moved through this sprint quickly because I had already completed this sprint when I started phase-0 last year. I had a clearer idea of what to expect in regards to keeping time using toggl so my time tracking was consistent too. 
##What didn't I do well this sprint? 
Due to intense work commitments, I was unable to dedicate more consistent time to phase-0 mahi after work as I was too tired. Therefore, I didn't finish sprint 1-3 as quickly as I would've liked (last week). 
##What can I improve on next sprint? 
I would like to complete sprint rua and toru by the end of tomorrow. I need to map out a clear pomodoro plan tonight in order to assess how realistic this goal is.
