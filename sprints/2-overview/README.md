## Wow.

>what happens if you put a div in a div in a div in a div in a ..., each one increasing in size by 1px? - Eugene Lynch.

Eugene's raindrops have temporarily disappeared from the Interwebs, but you can see a similar sort of thing [here](https://eda-demos.herokuapp.com/raindrops).


## Habits

<!-- learn > develop > practice -->
1. *Reflection*  
2. **Tidy**      

**Tidy** is the habit of keeping your code clean. If the project you are working on is successful, it is inevitable that you, or other people will work with it in the future. If you leave a mess, it is going to be very time and energy consuming to work with as it evolves in the future.


## Concepts

**NOTE: This is a big sprint and we expect it will overflow a little into the next sprint. Be steady, timebox your assignments and know that there will be less material in the next sprint and the chance to catch up.**

This sprint's concepts are delivered through Udacity - an educational organisation offering massive open online courses (MOOCs).
Udacity offer an excellent introduction to using HTML, CSS and the DOM in their "not your typical Web Dev" course. The majority of the work for this sprint is in the course - unless you're already proficient, in which case you should work on the stretch material.

Number | Name | Rough estimated time (hrs)*
--------|-------------------|----------
1. | [HTML, CSS and the DOM](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/html-css-dom-udacity) | 12
2. | [Git best practices](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/git-best-practice) | 1
3. | [HTML and CSS best practices -*Technical debt* 1](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/technical-debt-1) | 1
4. | [Emotional Intelligence](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/nt-emotional-intelligence) | 1
5. | Assignments (see below) | 6


## Assignments and resources

Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/`**cohort-year**`/`**cohort-year**`?assigned=`**yourGithubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohort-year' and 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/cohort-year/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.


## Next steps

1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts


## Handing in your work

- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task, and move it to the "Blocked" column
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
