## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/`**cohort-year**`/`**cohort-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohort-year' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/kakapo-2016/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.

## Next steps

2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts

## Handing in your work
- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task, and move it to the "Blocked" column
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
