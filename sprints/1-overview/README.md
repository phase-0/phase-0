# Sprint #1

> Mā te whakaaro nui e hanga te whare;
> mā te mātauranga e whakaū.

> *Big ideas create the house;*
> *knowledge maintains it.*

**Welcome to Dev Academy!** We are a house of ambitious ideas and we invite you to join with us and fill this house with knowledge. Every one of you brings a unique perspective, insights and experiences that we value. We warmly welcome you into our community of learning, collaboration and knowledge. Welcome to Enspiral Dev Academy!

## Phase-0 overview
You belong to a cohort, and together you will work through 9 weeks of 'sprints' - a bundle of core-habits, core-concepts and weekly assignments. Each week you will have the option to dive into the concepts or go straight to the assignments. 

Your journey is your own. There are no grades and there is no competition. Give yourself ample opportunity to better your knowledge. Be honest and real with yourself. Be honest and real with us. Dedicate yourself. Commit time. Say no to the immediacy of life and requests that can pull you away from your knowledge building experience and give yourself the best launchpad for your new career and skills. 

When times get tough, keep going. Reach out to us and your cohort and you will be supported. There is no shame in not knowing something and there is so much to gain from sharing your experience.

## Wow.
Every sprint we'll show you something inspiring. By the end of the couse, you'll be able to both dream up and build similar projects.
[Actionstation](http://www.actionstation.org.nz/about) was built by the Enspiral network to enable the large community of Kiwis with shared progressive values to take powerful, coordinated action on urgent issues we care about.

## Habits
Forming good habits is important. Really important. It can be the making or breaking of a hireable developer. If you have good habits, you'll take better care of yourself, your team and your code. We've carefully selected a set of habits for you to acquire - habits that we consider essential to your journey.

By definition a habit requires repetition to acquire. Each week we will introduce a new habit, while still focusing on the previous two weeks' habits.

A habit is similar to a theme for the week and will have concepts, practices and assignments associated with it. This week's habit is:

1. **Reflection**

**Reflection** helps us better fill this house of knowledge - be it journaling, talking to a friend or a reflective meditation.
The science behind reflection is compelling. We know intuitively that we learn by experience and also that we learn from our mistakes. But research is increasingly telling us that **without the process of actively thinking about those experiences,** and questioning ourselves about what they mean, learning doesn't really happen.

> A defining condition of being human is that we have to understand the meaning of our experience.
> *—Jack Mezirow*

## Concepts
Each week there will be new concepts. Concepts have a 'capability' section that can help you assess whether or not you have the capabilities. If you don't, then progress on to the resources and learn! If you do, you're more than welcome to fast forward to the assignments. Remember - don't rob yourself of understanding. Be real with yourself.

This week, the concepts are GitHub and the command line - tools that you will use for the rest of your web developer life. Getting set up with your tools is the first thing any web developer does. We also introduce you briefly to HTML and set up the foundations for a blog on which you will build each week.

## Assignments and resources
Each week you have a number of assignments to complete. Assignments are located in your cohort's waffle board and assigned to you. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/`**cohortBird-year**`?assigned=`**yourGithubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohortBird-yearGraduating' and 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/dev-academy-programme/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`

We provide you with curated material that our teachers have written, and/or amazing resources we've found on the web. In software engineering, 'don't repeat yourself' (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information. We apply software principles to our education model in many regards, including 'agile' course-ware and 'DRY' resources.

In most cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments. **Note however that feeling 'confident' isn't the Same as believing you can 'pass' the assignment. Feeling 'confident' is about feeling comfortable with the technology. For example, you could use the technology without using a step by step tutorial, and you could confidently describe to someone the features, uses, and examples of that technology/concept**

Assignments are due each Sunday at 11.59pm **However, an assignment grace of 2 applies - meaning if you are unable to complete an assignment by the due date, that is ok as long as there are no more than two assignments outstanding at anyone time.** In our experience, being any further behind puts you into danger zone and significantly reduces your chances of making it through to bootcamp. If you are going to exceed the 2 assignment grace, then please contact your facilitator immediately.

**We require 100% of the assignments to be completed by the end of Phase-0.** If you have incomplete assignments, we will likely ask you to roll back into another cohort to finish your assignments before you join a bootcamp. The deeper understanding, skills and habits you will learn during the assignments are essential for both bootcamp and your career as a web developer.

As part of the assignments, you will be required to complete a weekly feedback form. Your honest feedback is of great value - we use it to inform the changes that we make to the curriculum. Your experience combined with the experience of employers are the two major pillars of our course-ware design.

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Dive into the resources and develop your capabilities (linked from within the concepts)
4. Complete the assignments

## Handing in your work
- Check off all tasks within the assignments in waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Review" list in waffle.io as you complete them
- Complete all tasks and have assignments ready for review by midnight Sunday
- Email your facilitator if you might be exceeding the assignment grace limit.
