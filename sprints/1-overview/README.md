# Sprint #1

> Mā te whakaaro nui e hanga te whare;
> mā te mātauranga e whakaū.<br>
> _Big ideas create the house; knowledge maintains it._  

**Welcome to Dev Academy!** We are a house of ambitious ideas and we invite you to join with us and fill this house with knowledge. Every one of you brings a unique perspective, insights and experiences that we value. We warmly welcome you into our community of learning, collaboration and knowledge. Welcome to Enspiral Dev Academy!


## Phase 0 overview

You belong to a cohort, and together you will work through 9 _sprints_ - a bundle of core-habits, core-concepts and assignments. Each sprint will have the option to dive into the concepts or go straight to the assignments.

If you aren't a heavy reader, skim the concepts and note anything that seems useful. Long paragraphs of information aren't for everyone, so make sure you find a process (or **habit**) that works for you.

Your journey is your own. There are no grades and there is no competition. Give yourself ample opportunity to better your knowledge. Be honest and real with yourself. Be honest and real with us. Dedicate yourself. Commit time. Say no to the immediacy of life and requests that can pull you away from your knowledge building experience and give yourself the best launchpad for your new career and skills.

When times get tough, keep going. Reach out to us and your cohort and you will be supported. There is no shame in not knowing something and there is so much to gain from sharing your experience.


## Wow.

Every sprint we'll show you something inspiring. By the end of the couse, you'll be able to both dream up and build similar projects.
[Actionstation](http://www.actionstation.org.nz/about) was built by the Enspiral network to enable the large community of Kiwis with shared progressive values to take powerful, coordinated action on urgent issues we care about.


## Habits

Forming good habits is important. Really important. It can be the making or breaking of a hireable developer. If you have good habits, you'll take better care of yourself, your team and your code. We've carefully selected a set of habits for you to acquire - habits that we consider essential to your journey.

By definition a habit requires repetition to acquire. Each sprint we will introduce a new habit, while still focusing on some habits from prior sprints.

A habit is similar to a theme for the sprint and will have concepts, practices and assignments associated with it. This sprint's habits are:

1. **Reflection**

**Reflection** helps us better fill this house of knowledge - be it journaling, talking to a friend or a reflective meditation.
The science behind reflection is compelling. We know intuitively that we learn by experience and also that we learn from our mistakes. But research is increasingly telling us that **without the process of actively thinking about those experiences,** and questioning ourselves about what they mean, learning doesn't really happen.

> A defining condition of being human is that we have to understand the meaning of our experience.
> *—Jack Mezirow*

2. **Time Management**

Each sprint is designed to take 20-30 hours to complete. Depending on your experience and current work habits, a sprint could take more or less time

We encourage you to take the time you feel is needed for this first sprint, but keep an eye on what you use your time on, and **reflect** on how useful you found that allocated time.

If this first sprint takes you 30 hours to complete, you should expect each other sprint to take 30 hours as well. You should then probably put 35 hours aside, just to be safe.  


## Concepts

Each sprint there will be new concepts. Concepts have a _capability_ section that can help you assess whether or not you have the capabilities. If you don't, then progress on to the resources and learn! If you do, you're more than welcome to fast forward to the assignments. Remember - don't rob yourself of understanding. Be real with yourself.

For this first sprint, the concepts are GitHub and the command line - tools that you will use for the rest of your web developer life. Getting set up with your tools is the first thing any web developer does. We also introduce you briefly to HTML and set up the foundations for a blog on which you will build each sprint.

If you are unfamiliar with a concept, have a look at these lovely resources that help step you through the basics:
  * [Git/Github Walkthrough](./walkthroughs/git/gitBasics.md)
  * [HTML Walkthrough](./walkthroughs/html/htmlBasics.md)
  * [CSS Walkthrough](./walkthroughs/css/cssBasics.md)

## Assignments and resources
Each sprint you have a number of assignments (tasks) to complete. Assignments are located in your cohort's waffle board and assigned to you. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/`**cohort-year**`/`**cohort-year**`?assigned=`**yourGithubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohort-year' and 'GithubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/piwakawaka-2016/piwakawaka-2016?assigned=harrison-symes`

We provide you with curated material that our teachersme have written, and/or amazing resources we've found on the web. _Don't repeat yourself_ (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information. We apply software principles to our education model in many regards, including _agile_ course-ware and DRY resources.

In most cases, if you feel confident about the concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments. **Note however that feeling confident isn't the same as believing you can pass the assignment. Feeling confident is about feeling comfortable with the technology. For example, you could use the technology without using a step by step tutorial, and you could confidently describe to someone the features, uses, and examples of that technology/concept**

**You aren't required to complete one sprint per week**, but we strongly recommend you account for how many weeks you have until your desired bootcamp's starting date, and aim to be finsihed **before** that week.

**We require 100% of the assignments to be completed by the end of Phase 0.** If you have incomplete assignments, we will likely ask you to roll back into another cohort to finish your assignments before you join a bootcamp. The deeper understanding, skills and habits you will learn during the assignments are essential for both bootcamp and your career as a web developer.

As part of the assignments, you will be required to complete a feedback form (per sprint). Your honest feedback is of great value - we use it to inform the changes that we make to the curriculum. Your experience combined with the experience of employers are the two major pillars of our course-ware design.


## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts


## Handing in your work
- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task, and move it to the "Blocked" column
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything

  
- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
