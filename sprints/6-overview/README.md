6. **Communicate**

Web developers need excellent communication skills - for working together on problems, sharing difficulties, finding solutions, managing client and manager expectations, building systems that talk to each other, and writing readable code.  
Good communication leads to good relationships, less stress and better work. This course is an excellent chance for you to work on your communication skills - you'll need them at every step.

## Concepts

Number | Name | Rough estimated time (hrs)*
--------|-------------------|----------
1. | [Process over product](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/process-over-product) | 15 mins
2. | Assignments (see below) | 15 hours


## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/`**cohort-year**`/`**cohort-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohort-year' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/kakapo-2016/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, explore the resources that are linked from individual concepts

## Handing in your work
- If you find yourself blocked on a task,
  - Add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific waffle task, and move it to the "Blocked" column
  - Ask for help on slack in the **code-help-desk**/ your **campus-specific** channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!
  - Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything


- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!
